My Portfolio Website

Description: This is the beginning of my portfolio website. 
I say "beginning" because, as you will find out, there is little original content (e.g. "Lorem ipsum", etc.)
Yet, the structure, asthetics, and function do reflect what I set out to accomplish this semester.
There was embeded video on the splash page, as well as in the header, which made the experience 100% better,
but being that Github will not accept a file size greater than 100MB, this unfortunately had to be cut out
(for passing sake!).

Instructions: In your terminal, simply clone my repo link and begin by running "index.html" (as this is the 
initial splash page) in your text editor. Enjoy! :) 

Framework: HTML, CSS, JS (JQuery)
