My Portfolio Website

Description: Hello! This is the beginning of my portfolio website. 
I say "beginning" because, as you will find out, there is little original content (e.g. "Lorem ipsum", etc.) Yet, the structure, asthetics, and function do reflect what I set out to accomplish this semester.
Also, please allow a few seconds for the broswer to load the background video on both html pages (I am planning to fix this issue later).

Instructions: In your terminal, simply clone my repo link and begin by running "index.html" (as this is the initial splash page) in your text editor. Enjoy! :) 

Framework: HTML, CSS, JS (JQuery)
